TODO:
[x] More things should add memories: sharing food, being attacked by goblins, slaying goblins, etc
[x] move the dwarf hud into its own panel
[x] Extend dwarf memory to uncapped (instead of capped at 5)
[x] Give each dwarf a starting trait (e.g. lazy, forgetful, helpful, mean, paranoid, etc)
[x] Give each dwarf a quirky starting bio (e.g. "is far from home", "loves his dog", "never learned to swim", )
[x] Give each dwarf a personal goal
[x] 5 goblins spawn at the beginning and wander, instead of just later as a raid
[x] dwarves shouldn't yield to dead dwarves while foraging (d.alive check already present)

[x] dwarf hud should not have less opacity for dead dwarves
[x] use a tombstone sprite for dead dwarves instead of a flipped red dwarf
[x] ore is gathered to another community stockpiole
[x] dwarves can use ore to create walls
[x] dwaves try to build fortified spaces around the depot and stockpile (enclosed areas surrounded by walls)
[x] memories: each hit by a goblin should not create a memory
[x] memories: building fort walls should not create a memory
[x] console: make it less noisey (remove each health update, each wall placement, etc)
[x] have minors favor ore over food when they have enough food
[x] have dwarves favor finding food over their base goals (i.e. fighter chasing goblins) at certain hunger/health thresholds



Questions (don't start without clarifying):
[ ] question: should only a leader dwarf be able to call the llm?
