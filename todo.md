TODO:
[x] More things should add memories: sharing food, being attacked by goblins, slaying goblins, etc
[x] move the dwarf hud into its own panel
[x] Extend dwarf memory to uncapped (instead of capped at 5)
[x] Give each dwarf a starting trait (e.g. lazy, forgetful, helpful, mean, paranoid, etc)
[x] Give each dwarf a quirky starting bio (e.g. "is far from home", "loves his dog", "never learned to swim", )
[x] Give each dwarf a personal goal
[x] 5 goblins spawn at the beginning and wander, instead of just later as a raid
[x] dwarves shouldn't yield to dead dwarves while foraging (d.alive check already present)

[x] dwarf hud should not have less opacity for dead dwarves
[x] use a tombstone sprite for dead dwarves instead of a flipped red dwarf
[x] ore is gathered to another community stockpile
[x] dwarves can use ore to create walls
[x] dwarves try to build fortified spaces around the depot and stockpile (enclosed areas surrounded by walls)

Questions (don't start without clarifying):
[ ] question: should a leader dwarf only call the llm?
